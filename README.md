# Machine Learning Models Repository

This repository contains various machine learning models developed for different tasks, including movie genre classification, customer churn prediction, and spam SMS detection.

## Project Overview

### 1. Movie Genre Classification
- **Objective:** Built a model to classify movie genres using textual data.
- **Techniques Used:** TF-IDF, Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes and SVM.
- **Description:** This project involves preprocessing movie plot summaries, transforming the text data using TF-IDF, and training a Logistic Regression model to predict the genre of movies accurately.

### 2. Customer Churn Prediction
- **Objective:** Developed a customer churn prediction model for subscription-based services.
- **Techniques Used:** Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting.
- **Description:** This project involves using historical customer data, including usage behavior and demographics, to predict customer churn. The models were trained using Random Forest and Gradient Boosting algorithms to achieve the best results.

### 3. Spam SMS Detection
- **Objective:** Designed an AI model to detect spam SMS messages.
- **Techniques Used:** TF-IDF, Naive Bayes Classification, Logistic Regression and SVM.
- **Description:** This project involves preprocessing SMS messages, using word embeddings to represent the text data, and training a Naive Bayes classifier to detect spam messages effectively.
